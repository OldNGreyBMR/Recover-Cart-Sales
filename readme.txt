Recover Cart Sales (RCS) plugin for Zen Cart v1.5

=============
DESCRIPTION:
=============
Recover Cart Sales Tool is an admin utility for Zen Cart allowing merchants to send individual or 
bulk email messages to customers who have set up a shop account and added items to their shopping 
cart, but for various reasons did not complete submitting an order (this is known as an 'abandoned 
cart'). The tool also generates a report listing the "possible" response to your email, informing 
you if customer followed up with a purchase from your shop. The email sent to these customers may 
help educate your customers about your shop and at the same time assist you the merchant in identifying 
trends and individual reasons behind abandoned carts. Use this tool diligently. 
Compose your email message carefully. Don't burden your customers with undesirable repeat messages. 
The idea here is to "recover" sales and reduce abandoned carts, not lose customers.

===================
HOW TO USE THE MOD:
===================
1. Customers > Abandoned Carts:
   Search for abandoned carts to "recover" and compose/send individual/bulk email to customers.

    After configuring RCS in "CONFIGURE" step above:

    a. Search for customers who still have items in their shopping cart.
        (first set the number of days back you want to search for abandoned carts)
    b. Results will appear as "uncontacted" or "previously contacted by RCS"
    c. Check the box next to the customers you want to send a bulk RCS email
    d. Compose the body of the bulk email you will send to customers (see RCS email template in /admin/includes/languages/english/recover_cart_sales.php)
    e. Set an appropriate subject and your store email address 
    f. Send email

    NOTE: Before sending bulk messages it's best to create a test account, add item to shopping cart (don't order) then select ONLY your "uncontacted" email 
          address to send you a test RCS message. Then view the message to ensure the results are as desired. 
 
2. Reports > Recovered Sales Results:
   Display RCS email results report (that is, did customers return to your shop and resubmit abandoned cart or buy other items?) 

    a. Select the number of days to show.

    b. The results will present the following in the report:

    Examined Records:   
    Recovered Sales:     
    (Possible sales from customers who abanoned carts & were notified via RCS)

    For each "recovered sale" the report will display:
    - SCart ID  (entry number in the "scart" table in the db)
    - Date Added to SC  
        - RC email sent     
        - Customer Name     
        - Order Date    
        - Status    
        - Amount

    Note: Once an order arrives from customer cart listed on the abandoned cart list, the entry on the list 
          should be automatically cleared and then the customer's orders should automatically display on the RCS report.
    
=============
MAINTENANCE:
=============   
Occassionally flush out your "scart" db table (via phpmyadmin). Be sure to check your uncontacted/contacted list and 
RCS report before flushing.

========================================
COMMON KNOWN ISSUES:
========================================
- Supports sending text email only, not HTML. Sent message is based on Zen Cart email template.
- When a customer with an abandoned cart is deleted from Zen Cart, sometimes the cart can still stick around in the database, 
  and then RCS reports the cart data without connecting it to a customer. And then you cannot clear the item from the RCS report. 
  If this occurs flushing your 'scart' db table (via phpmyadmin) is recommended.
- RCS sometimes reports incorrect dates in abandoned cart list and the report. If you have solutions please post to the support forum.
